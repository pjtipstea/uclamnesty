This investigation allows direct visualization of the lower rectum and anal canal, areas most likely to be the source of the bleeding in this clinical scenario.

---

### Question 14
A long history is provided about a woman's breast cancer diagnosis, including details about her reproductive history. Which of the following is her greatest risk factor for developing breast cancer?
- A) Late menarche
- B) Early menarche
- C) Late menopause
- D) Obesity
- E) Having multiple children

**Answer: B) Early menarche**

**Explanation:** Early menarche is a known risk factor for breast cancer. The earlier onset of menstruation increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen, raising the risk of developing breast cancer over a woman's lifetime. This factor is more directly related to the risk of breast cancer than late menopause, obesity, or reproductive history, such as the number of children she has had.

---

### Question 24
How does sildenafil cause postural hypotension?
- A) By blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors
- B) By inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), resulting in vasodilation
- C) By direct vasodilation of peripheral vessels
- D) By reducing cardiac output
- E) By increasing heart rate

**Answer: B) By inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), resulting in vasodilation**

**Explanation:** Sildenafil causes postural hypotension primarily through its action as a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. This mechanism leads to vasodilation by increasing levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle, thereby reducing blood pressure, which can be particularly noticeable when changing positions.

---

### Question 25
A biopsy from a patient shows ground-glass hepatocytes. The patient's alpha-1-antitrypsin levels are low, and there is suspicion of Wilson's disease. However, the correct diagnosis is most associated with which condition?

**Answer: C) Hold frusemide and observe**

**Explanation:** In the case of slowly correcting hyponatremia, especially in a patient potentially receiving diuretic therapy, it is prudent to hold frusemide (a loop diuretic that can exacerbate hyponatremia by promoting water excretion) and observe the patient's response. This approach allows for the assessment of the natural correction of hyponatremia without further interventions that might lead to rapid changes in sodium levels.

### Question 105
A patient with a severe respiratory infection presents with a serum sodium of 119 mmol/L and a urinary sodium of 70 mmol/L. Which is the single most appropriate management option for this patient?
- A) Administer hypertonic saline solution
- B) Restrict fluid intake
- C) Increase dietary sodium intake
- D) Administer loop diuretics
- E) Provide oxygen therapy

**Answer: B) Restrict fluid intake**

**Explanation:** The patient's hyponatremia in the setting of a high urinary sodium suggests syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), likely secondary to severe respiratory infection. The most appropriate management is fluid restriction to correct the hyponatremia gradually.

### Question 112
A woman who has been using pads for the past year due to continuous urine leakage underwent radiotherapy for cervical cancer. What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?
- A) Urinary tract infection
- B) Interstitial cystitis
- C) Vesicovaginal fistula
- D) Urethral stricture
- E) Overactive bladder syndrome

**Answer: C) Vesicovaginal fistula**

**Explanation:** Continuous urine leakage requiring the use of pads, especially in a patient with a history of radiotherapy for cervical cancer, suggests the development of a vesicovaginal fistula. This condition occurs when there is an abnormal connection between the urinary bladder and the vagina, allowing urine to bypass the urethra and leak continuously into the vaginal vault.

### Question 119
A patient presents with a history of jaundice and now reports feeling generally well. Laboratory tests reveal positive anti-HBc IgG, negative HBsAg, and positive anti-HBs, suggesting past infection with resolution and immunity against Hepatitis B. Additionally, the patient has positive anti-HCV and HCV RNA but negative anti-HDV IgM. Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of these findings?
- A) Infections with hepatitis A and B and previous immunization against hepatitis B
- B) Infections with hepatitis B and C and previous immunization against hepatitis A
- C) Infections with hepatitis A and C and previous immunization against hepatitis B
- D) None of the above; symptoms are not due to hepatitis A or C
- E) Infections with hepatitis B and C and previous immunization against hepatitis B

**Answer: E) Infections with hepatitis B and C and previous immunization against hepatitis B**

**Explanation:** The laboratory findings indicate a past infection with hepatitis B (as evidenced by positive anti-HBc IgG, negative HBsAg, and positive anti-HBs) and a current infection with hepatitis C (indicated by positive anti-HCV and HCV RNA). The presence of anti-HBs also suggests previous immunization or resolved infection with immunity against hepatitis B.

### Question 121
A basketball player reports knee pain and "locking" after a heavy landing during a game. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
- A) Medial meniscus tear
- B) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage
- C) Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) damage
- D) Collateral ligament damage
- E) Patellar dislocation

**Answer: A) Medial meniscus tear**

**Explanation:** Knee locking is a symptom often associated with meniscal tears, particularly of the medial meniscus, due to the knee's inability to fully extend or flex as a result of the torn cartilage getting caught in the knee joint.

### Question 123
Which of the following is the most specific sign of left ventricular failure (LVF)?
- A) S3 gallop
- B) S4 gallop
- C) Ejection systolic murmur
- D) Mitral regurgitation murmur
- E) Kussmaul's sign

**Answer: A) S3 gallop**

**Explanation:** An S3 gallop is a low-frequency sound heard just after S2, particularly in patients with heart failure, and is most specific for left ventricular failure as it indicates increased fluid volume and pressure inside the ventricle.

### Question 124
A patient with severe asthma exacerbation is admitted with an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing a PCO2 of 8 kPa, higher than normal, indicating potential respiratory failure. Given these findings and signs of tiring, which is the most appropriate next step in management?
- A) Increase inhaled corticosteroids
- B) Administer intravenous bronchodilators
- C) Immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation
- D) Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)
- E) High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy

**Answer: C) Immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation**

**Explanation:** A PCO2 that is high in the context of an acute asthma exacerbation indicates hypercapnic respiratory failure, suggesting that the patient is tiring and unable to adequately ventilate. Immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation are required to support breathing and manage gas exchange.
