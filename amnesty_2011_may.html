            { 'question': 'A 45-year-old man presents with confusion, rapid breathing, and fruity-smelling breath. His blood test shows Na: 140 mEq/L, K: 5 mEq/L, Cl: 100 mEq/L, and HCO3: 18 mEq/L. What is the most likely cause of his condition?', 'choices': ['A) Diabetic ketoacidosis', 'B) Drug overdose', 'C) Lactic acidosis', 'D) Chronic kidney disease', 'E) Liver cirrhosis', "100 - 18), which is higher than the normal range (10-20). This suggests the presence of an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's symptoms are characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis."], 'answer': 'A) Diabetic ketoacidosis', 'explanation': "** The calculated anion gap is 27 (140 + 5 - 100 - 18), which is higher than the normal range (10-20). This suggests the presence of an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient's symptoms are characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a common cause of anion gap metabolic acidosis." },

The initial management of DKA involves fluid replacement to correct dehydration, followed by insulin to lower blood glucose levels. Calcium gluconate is not the first-line treatment as the high potassium is likely a result of acidosis and not true hyperkalemia." },
