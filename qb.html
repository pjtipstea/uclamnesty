Pelvic X-ray shows mixed areas of sclerosis and lucency in the right hemipelvis, coarsening of the trabecular pattern, and reduction in hip joint space. Which lab finding is most relevant?', 'choices': ['A) Elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration', 'B) Decreased plasma calcium', 'C) Elevated plasma uric acid', 'D) Decreased plasma phosphate', 'E) Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)'], 'answer': 'A) Elevated plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration', 'explanation': "** The described radiographic findings suggest a process of bone remodeling, which could be indicative of Paget's disease of bone. Elevated plasma ALP concentration is a hallmark of increased osteoblastic activity seen in this condition." },
